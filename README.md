# Mental Health Assessment Program
Computerized Self-Administered Tests for Assessing Mental Health Status

## What is MHA Program?
Health is an asset that helps us maintain the balance of life and a sound mind. 
It's the true elixir for a happy life as it leads to a calm and composed mind. 
*Mental Health Assessment* is a program that contains four different mental health tests. 
The following questions in every test will elucidate the significance and vitality of being 
healthy in our lives and will aid us in improving the health of others. 
                            
However, **the assessments do not signifify as diagnostic tests**, but rather, self-assessments. 
                            
Thank you!

## The Inspiration
Mental health is a significant part of a person's well being, but is often overlooked by people. 
Anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia are some of the most common mental health disorders unknowingly suffered by individuals. 
When an individual is unaware of their mental health state, they would think that their struggles are completely normal. 
Dealing with these struggles alone can be detrimental to a person's well-being as time progresses. 
The creators of this program decided to make a Mental Health Self-Assessment Program that can determine the individual's mental health state just by taking the test. 
With this program, people can have awareness of their mental health and address their mental health issues as soon as possible. 
The tests can also give recommendations to the user whether they should seek professional help.
